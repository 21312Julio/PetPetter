## Walkthrough
Pet Petter is a mobile Android clicker-game created with Unity, where you can level up your pets and discover the different name and sprite combinations. As a player, the attributes you have are Coins, PPC (Pats-per-click), and PPS (Pats-per-second). You can get coins per second as the game goes on, as well as by patting your pet. In order to have visual elements to give feedback to the player, you find on the main screen of the game an EXPats bar on the current amount of exp you have and each time you click on the pet image, you get both visual and sound feedback.

In order to increase the amount of PPC and PPS you can spend your coins on the shop panel and upgrade panel. The price is coded in a way to gradually increase along with the amount of each itens you currently have.

For each 10 levels you can get a new pet and the sprites and name of your pet will change and be decided automatically. There are many possible combinations for
the player to discover! The amount of EXP you need also gradually increases and cycles through the amount of levels you already have. The data of the game is being constantly updated and saved using a Binary Formatter, and the information is then loaded once the application is opened.
